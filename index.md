##Story

##Gameplay
####Mechanics
The game will feature a simple set of mechanics of avoidence and reward. Players will move across the screen dodging the plentiful attacks of the demon while simultaniously attacking back at the demon. Both the player and the demon have a health bar, so its a battle of who dies first! Additionaly there will be a risk mechanic where the player can charge a special attack but become slower while charging. This increases the chance of being struck by an enemy attack!
####Controls
Player will only need a mouse to play this game. Players will move the mouse to move up,down, left and right. To fire, player will left click. To charge a special attack players will need to hold right click.
##Teaching the Game
Players will learn how to play the game via a how to play section reached from the main menu.
##Player Learning
In order to beat the demon, players will need to lean certain items. First, the player will need to know the types of attacks the demon will use and effective ways to dodge them. Next, players will need to understand that using charged attacks will be necessary to beat the demon before they are overwhelmed by the demon's attacks. Once the player understands which attacks they can charge up with lower risk of being hit, they will beat the game.
